      - One day I was browsing my hard drive to see if there are any useless files. I stumbled upon an old web portfolio I created for one of my classes. Out of curiosity and boredom, I decided to take a look and it reminded me all the fun I had in that class. Thus taken by nostalgia (and boredom), I decided that maybe it&#39;s the day I revamp the portfolio into something that would fit my taste today. So I will actually make use of it, instead of let it sit in a corner and gather dust.

      - Start off with baseline structure, I actually like a lot of the old components present in the old portfolio, such as the little clouds at top left of the page. However, there are a lot more that bothers me, such as the messy coding. Thus I decided to start from ground up and try to retain as much as original element as possible. First I decide to change my frame work from Bootstrap to Materialize, since it will be a lot easier for me to create a material design using Materialize. I also decided to remove the little clouds I loved so much, due to the fact that it caused a lot of trouble when the page is viewed in mobile.
      - The old index page, while cute, always make me feel like its very messy. Thus for the revamped index page, I want something slick. Since I&#39;m always fascinated by parallax image, I used parallax for my new index page, a lot of them. I think it help with keeping the page organized while not crammed with information.
      - The old projects page was colorful indeed, but it is very hard to view it without wanting to drink some bleach. I decide to tune down on the color and use something more simple. Thus the simple list to list out all the projects ordered by year without using the crazy color to differentiate different projects. As for page of each individual project, I actually have nothing bad to say about it, except the horrible font. Therefore, I keep the design of the individual project page, only with some minor changes to fit the new style.
