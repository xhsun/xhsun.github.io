      - I&#39;ve been playing Guild Wars 2 since the first day of release, which just so happens to be my first day of university. Now that I graduated from the university, I want to do something nice to the community that&#39;ve always been a part of that journey. Since I major in computer science, I think it would be the best that I make a program, using the skills I learned from my university, for Guild Wars 2. I decided that my program will be an android application so that the program will not take up screen space on user&#39;s computer.
      - Since Guild Wars 2 released its first expansion, the base game becomes free to play. I know multiple people including myself that have multiple accounts because of that. However, managing resource between accounts aren&#39;t exactly easy and multi-boxing isn&#39;t supported by the game. Thus, I decided that my application will provide a way for users to view what resources do they have on each Guild wars 2 accounts they own.
      - But I feel like just the feature mentioned above doesn&#39;t provide much to the user, thus I want to add more features to my application. So, I looked at some popular fan-made web-based tools and see if there is anything I can include. However, some of the features requires a dedicated server. Yet, I don&#39;t exactly have the resource to provide such server. Thus, I decided to only include boss timer, dungeon tracker, and build template for now.
      - Done deciding what to include for my application, I need a name for it. So, I named it Steve, after the Guild Wars 2&#39;s mysterious water-base elder dragon (well&#8230; Steve is a name given to that elder dragon by the Guild Wars 2 community).
