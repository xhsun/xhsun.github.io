Each content model class follows the exact same format presented by <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:2">official wiki</a>. Thus a good way to know what to expect from a model class is to go to the API wiki page and see what is in the response for that endpoint. For example, the response for <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:2/tokeninfo">/v2/tokeninfo</a>&#58;

<blockquote cite="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:2/tokeninfo">
  <ul>
 <li>id (string) - The API key that was requested.</li>
 <li>name (string) - The name given to the API key by the account owner. <strong>Warning</strong>: The value of this field is not escaped and may contain valid HTML, JavaScript, other code. Handle with care.</li>
 <li>permissions (array) - Array of strings describing which permissions the API key has.</ul>
 </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

The format for TokenInfo class is:

{% highlight java %}
public class TokenInfo {
  private String id;
  private String name;
  private String[] permissions;
  //getters
}
{% endhighlight %}

<sub><i>Note: If parts of response of an endpoint is not documented on the wiki, I probably will missed it in my model class.
So if you see anything I missed, please don't hesitate to create an <a href="https://github.com/xhsun/gw2wrapper/issues">issue</a> to let me know.</i></sub>
